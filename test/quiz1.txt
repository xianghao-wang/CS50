3. use this one-time pad several times on each 2 bytes

4. For example, the length of one-time pad is 16. If the bits in encryped data at 1th and 17th index are different, we can know bits at 1 and 17 index
in origin dat are different. If they are same in encrypted data, we can know they are the same in origin one. 

5. swap

7. Suppose we have A, B, C for original data. We can backup them onto D such that D = A XOR B XOR C
